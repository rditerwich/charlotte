			<h1>Listen</h1>
			<p>The Web today is vast sweeping network of conversations. Many of them are important to you: they're 
			about your brand, your clients, your competitors, your industry or about You or your family. They're 
			happening right now, on millions of sites, among millions of people.</p>

			<p>You need to be armed with intelligence about your online brand presence, and you need the tools to 
			deliver those insights to your company or clients. 
			Let Charlotte help you get immersed, connected and to formulate measurable goals for where you're headed, 
			so you can start answering:

			<ul>
			<li>Who's talking about us, and what are they saying?</li>
			<li>Is our brand being reflected on the Web the way we'd like it to be?</li>
			<li>Are we keeping up with and aware of our competition?</li>
			<li>Who are the influential voices in our industry?</li>
			<li>Where is our community hanging out online?</li>

			<h1>Engage</h1>
			<p>Being part of communities and conversations is how business development works today. Such engagement 
			however is different for every business or individual. And getting started can be daunting. There are 
			varying ways to engage with your community in social media or the global Web, depending on the conversations 
			happening around you, and Charlotte can help you keep tabs on it all.</p>

			<p>With Charlotte's proprietary software W.A.R.P. conversations and efficient outreach are so much easier. 
			You can manage the workflow, assign and route your posts, tag your sources, and if necessary equip your entire 
			team for coordinated and organized (social media) engagement.</p>

			<h1>Measure</h1>
			<p>Ultimately, what you want to understand is how the social web is affecting your business or personal brand. 
			Some measurements are classic, but their implication is broader thanks to the social web. Campaigns and news 
			spread faster and farther than they did before, and we can help you track whatever there's said about you. 
			Context and discussion around your brand can advance your efforts by reflecting the language your community uses. 
			And reach now is defined by more than just newspaper subscriptions &ndash; it's Twitter followers, influencers, commenters on blogs, 
			or the different type of media that carry conversations about your brand.</p>

			<p>Some metrics are evolutions. Share of voice was relevant when eyes and ears were all that mattered. Now, what you want is the right eyes and ears, and dialogue and discussion about your brand or your client's business. Whether and how you're part of the conversation.</p>

			<p>With Charlotte you have access to a dashboard to see whether your investment in community increases your share in conversations over time, or improves your positive sentiment ratio, or adds more content-related website conversions.</p>
